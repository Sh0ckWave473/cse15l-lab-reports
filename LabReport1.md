* Remotely Connecting

If you have git, you do not need to install the program. Otherwise follow this [link](https://gitforwindows.org/) and
install it to your device.
Now, have VScode open and open a new terminal by using Terminal &rarr; New Terminal from the drop down menu
Afterwards, enter this command into your terminal: 

*ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu* 

(zz should be replaced with whatever shows up in your own username)

If the command worked correctly, your should see a message asking you if you want to continue connecting. It is fine to say **yes**.
This will cause the terminal to ask for your password which should be the password for your own account that was created earlier. 
If it all works, you should see this ![Image](unnamed(1).png)
