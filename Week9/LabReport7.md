What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?

I am using VSCode on a Windows computer.

Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.

It seems like the symptom for my program is when I input more than two elements after the bash script. What I am trying to get output is all of the fibonacci values at the specified indices that are provided in order. But I only get one.

Detail the failure-inducing input and context. That might mean any or all of the command you're running, a test case, command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran. Do your best to provide as much context as you can.
